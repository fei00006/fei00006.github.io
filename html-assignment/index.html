                <p>
                    <em>Hi!</em> Nice to meet you, I'm Karen. 
                    A little bit about myself; I am a parent to two cats, <em>Oscar</em> and <em>Rosie</em>. When I was younger I played table tennis and swam competitively.
                    I like to draw and have gotten a lot more serious about it in the past few years. 
                    I have done some freelance commissions as well as started my own Etsy shop. I would love to make a career out of my passions.
                </p>

                    While I did graduate from the programming course here at Algonquin, I found that it didn't suit my creative interests.
                    Funnily enough I still find myself here in this Web dev class. 
                    That being said, I don't believe the Computer Programming program placed a large focus on web dev and design, so I look forward to getting the most I can out of these classes. 
                    <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> looked like a good balance between my interests and practical/technical skills which is why I am currently here in the program.
